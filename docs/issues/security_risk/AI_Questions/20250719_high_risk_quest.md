# Questions for you:
1. For the requests vulnerability (#1): The report mentions a .netrc credentials leak vulnerability. Do you have any information about which specific version this vulnerability was fixed in? Your current version (2.32.3) is very recent, and the latest (2.32.4) is just a minor update.

2. For the werkzeug vulnerability (#2): The report mentions DoS via multipart form data. Your version (3.1.3) is the latest available. Do you have any information about when this vulnerability was introduced and fixed?

3. How was this security assessment generated? Was it from a tool like safety, bandit, or another security scanner? This would help me understand the context better.
