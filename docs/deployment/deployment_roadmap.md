# Deployment Roadmap: BudgetSync

## üìå Purpose
This document outlines the recommended roadmap for containerization and cloud deployment of **BudgetSync**.  
The objective is to evolve BudgetSync from a local development project into a **production-ready, cloud-hosted backend application**.  
This roadmap provides a staged approach covering **Dockerization**, **AWS integration**, and **future enhancements** such as Snowflake.

---

## 1. üê≥ Dockerization (Phase 1)

### Goals
- Achieve consistent and reproducible environments across local, staging, and production.
- Package BudgetSync into one or more containers (application + database).
- Provide a standardized entry point for running and testing the application.

### Tasks
1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**
   - Base image: `python:3.12-slim`
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Run application with `gunicorn` or `uvicorn` (production-ready server)

2. **Add `docker-compose.yml`**
   - Define services:
     - `app` (Flask/Backend)
     - `db` (Postgres)
     - `redis` (session store)
   - Configure environment variables via `.env` file

3. **Update Project Structure**
   - Add `docker/` folder for config and entrypoint scripts
   - Add `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

4. **Test Locally**
   - Verify that `docker-compose up` spins up the full stack
   - Confirm DB migrations and Redis session handling work as expected

## 2. ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment (Phase 2)

### Goals
- Host BudgetSync on AWS with high availability and scalability.
- Use managed services where possible to reduce operational overhead.
- Ensure secrets and sensitive data are handled securely.

### Services & Architecture
- **App Hosting**: AWS App Runner (preferred, container-native) or Elastic Beanstalk
- **Database**: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
- **Session Store**: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager (DB credentials, API keys)
- **Monitoring & Logging**: AWS CloudWatch

### Tasks
1. **Push Docker Image to ECR**
   - Configure AWS Elastic Container Registry
   - Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD to build and push Docker images

2. **Provision RDS (Postgres)**
   - Create production database instance
   - Apply schema migrations
   - Connect to BudgetSync via environment variables

3. **Configure Redis via ElastiCache**
   - Replace local Redis container with AWS-managed service
   - Update Flask session configuration

4. **Deploy via App Runner**
   - Point App Runner to ECR image
   - Configure environment variables, secrets, and IAM roles
   - Enable automatic redeploy on new image pushes

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Forward application logs to CloudWatch
   - Configure alarms for DB/CPU/memory usage

## 3. ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake Integration (Phase 3 ‚Äì Future)

### Goals
- Extend BudgetSync with enterprise-grade analytics capabilities.
- Showcase integration with a modern data warehouse widely used in fintech.
- Support advanced queries (OLAP-style reporting, cost trend analysis).

### Use Cases
- Replicate Postgres data into Snowflake for analytics
- Create dashboards for spending patterns, tax exposure, and budget forecasting
- Demonstrate **ETL pipelines** (using Airflow, dbt, or custom Python scripts)

### Tasks
1. Set up Snowflake account and warehouse
2. Build a lightweight ETL pipeline from RDS ‚Üí Snowflake
3. Create analytical views (spend by category, month-over-month comparisons)
4. Document integration as an **advanced feature** of BudgetSync

## üß≠ Implementation Sequence

1. **Phase 1: Dockerization**
   - Immediate priority, improves local dev + prepares app for cloud deployment
   - Duration: ~1 week

2. **Phase 2: AWS Deployment**
   - Core production-readiness step
   - Focus: App Runner + RDS + ElastiCache
   - Duration: ~2‚Äì3 weeks including CI/CD

3. **Phase 3: Snowflake Integration**
   - Strategic enhancement once AWS stack is stable
   - Adds strong fintech positioning
   - Duration: flexible (2‚Äì4 weeks)

---

## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes
- **Professional Deployment Workflow**: Dockerized services with CI/CD pipelines
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Hosted on AWS with managed database and caching
- **Scalable Data Strategy**: Ability to integrate Snowflake for analytics

This roadmap ensures that **BudgetSync** is not only production-ready but also **fintech-relevant**, aligning directly with the expectations of companies such as **Affirm, Stripe, or Plaid**.
